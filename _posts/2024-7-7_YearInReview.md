We have had an eventful and exciting year in the DEAD Lab! With thanks to our amazing team and a fantastic set of collaborators, we have made major strides in advancing our understanding of the ecology of lightning, storms, lianas, and giant trees. Most importantly, we had many new additions to the research group, which are fueling all of these achievements.

Postdoc Ian McGregor joined the lab in August of 2023 to work on our NSF-funded investigation of lightning in Panama. He is improving methods for drone-based measurements of forest disturbance and working closely with colleague Jeff Burchfield (The University of Alabama in Huntsville) on the processing, filtering, and analysis of data from the field change meter array in Panama, which allows us to locate and quantify 10,000s of lightning strikes across >8,000 km2 of forest in central Panama. 

Ian was followed shortly thereafter by postdoc Vanessa Rubio and technicians Cesar Gutierrez and Fernando Arauz. Vanessa is co-advised by Adriane Esquivel-Muelbert who is the UK co-lead of our NSF-NERC Gigante project investigating the mortality of giant trees, and she is already leading exciting analyses exploring the ecology and importance of long-lived giant trees. Cesar is the head technician of our lab group in Panama with contributions to all our projects there, while Fernando is focusing on data collection for the Gigante project. 

In April, postdoc Gisele Biem Mori (UNEMAT) and technician Pinduca Prado (FAESPE) joined the Gigante project in Brazil, while Esteban Garcia Sandoval joined the lightning project in Panama. Gisele will lead the Gigante project in Brazil, and she is starting her research on this project by conducting a pantropical analysis asking, "What is a giant tree?" Pinduca is a legend in the field who will be a key part of our team collecting data in Reserva Ducke near Manaus. We recently began sampling vegetation across 10-year chronosequences of lightning and wind-caused canopy gaps in Panama; Esteban is working on these chronoseuqneces with a focus on soil sampling while he develops an independent project investigating carbon cycling across these gaps. 

Aside from these new lab projects, Evan worked with external colleagues and former mentees to complete various other projects. Collaborator Camille Delavaux (UTH) and a great team of collaborators to publish a paper in Nature providing rare evidence that mutualisms are key to the maintenance of high plant diversity in tropical ecosystems. Former intern Ángela Barrera Bello published her internship project in the journal Ecosystems, completed her Master’s degree in the TropiMundo program, and received a fellowship to conduct her PhD at University of British Columbia. Evan also finished a long-languishing project inferring drivers of liana mortality based on concurrent patterns of tree death in collaboration with Stefan Schnitzer (Marquette) and David DeFillipis (Marquette). Last but not least, Max Adams (George Washington University) led a cool manuscript exploring how habitat and competition interact to shape arboreal ant community composition and structure.
