Over the past couple months, the DEAD lab membership has increased in size! Below we welcome two new postdocs and two field technicians.

We first welcome Dr. Ian McGregor coming to us from a recently completed PhD at North Carolina State University. There Ian focused on near real-time deforestation monitoring and built an algorithm to combine optical and synthetic aperture radar data to see how quickly deforestation could be detected. Since August, he has been using his expertise with remote sensing to assist with the lightning project and some of the drone processing.

We next welcome Dr. Vanessa Rubio arriving from University of Notre Dame, where her dissertation revolved around plant community assembly...Vanessa will be spending most of her time on the Gigante project and helping to develop a protocol that eventually will be used at several other sites across the Tropics. Although she started at Barro Colorado Island in October, we are excited to have her in person at the Cary Institute later this fall!

Finally, we have two new field technicians who are joining us to lend their skills in tropical forest fieldwork - César Gutierrez and Fernando Araúz.
