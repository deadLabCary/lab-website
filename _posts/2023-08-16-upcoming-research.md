**Open full post for hyperlinks**. There are a lot of exciting, upcoming things in the lab! In the last couple months, Evan has had a few proposals funded, including
- a NASA project looking at using AI to detect tree flowering phenology
- a major project from NSF that will investigate mortality of large tropical trees. See an overview of the project in a recent [Cary news brief](https://www.caryinstitute.org/news-insights/feature/whats-killing-giant-tropical-trees-17m-awards-cary-led-team-aims-find-out).

Stay tuned for some exciting things in the near future!
