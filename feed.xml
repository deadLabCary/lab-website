<p>Welcome to new postdoc Gisele Biem Mori, field technician Flamarion Prado Assunção (Pinduca), and affiliate PhD student Gustavo Lemes! All of them are based in Brazil.

<p>Adriane, Evan, and Vanessa traveled to Manaus to start the Gigante project at Reserva Ducke along with the new lab members. They all saw really cool giant trees, flooded streams, 
soil types, all types of gaps, evidence of lightning in the forest, snakes, toucans, and a harpy eagle! The most abundant giant tree at Ducke is Dinizia excelsa (known there as angelim) 
from the Fabaceae family. It rained most of the days in the field, but the rain helped to cool down the otherwise very hot days during this field campaign.  Most of the time in the forest
was spent practicing the field protocol, training Pinduca, Isabella Braga and César Arruda da Silva, installing soil moisture and temperature probes, and building the resistograph protocol 
for studying tree heartrot. However, there was also time for cooking very good farofa (toasted cassava flour with sweet plantain) and eating delicious tapioca (cassava flour “crepes”) . 
During some of the days they participated in media coverage with lots of filming and interviews about the Gigante project. Stay tuned for the release!</p>

<p>Field update from Panama featuring lightning, drones, and Gigantes.
<!-- excerpt end --></p>

<p>Hello from Barro Colorado Island in Panama! The DEAD lab has been busy these past few weeks as research is ramping up in support of the lightning project and Gigante. In late September, Evan and Ian traveled to the island to start trying to find recent lightning strikes using the electromagnetic sensors set up across central Panama. Unfortunately, they quickly found out that due to El Niño this year there have been very few storms compared to a normal wet season, and those that have developed have had very few actual lightning strikes on the ground. In fact, lightning isn’t the only thing that’s been affected by the weather patterns; the canal is at its lowest water level in recent years, in some spots holding steady at 2m below what it should be. Instead of searching for new strikes from a drone flight the previous week that Jeff flew, Ian got to work processing previous drone imagery to see if there were older strikes the lab could hike to. After a team effort of finding potential strikes and gaps in the orthomosaics, Evan, Jeff, Matt, and Ian together spent several days walking through the rainforest for a couple reasons. First, Ian and Matt were trained on how identify lightning strikes, and second, we all developed and tested a field survey protocol for the lightning project in the long run. Despite the heat, at least only one of the days had a full downpour!</p>

<p>Besides the field work, Evan - along with Vanessa and collaborator Dr. Adriane Esquivel-Muelbert - has fully started on the Gigante project by creating the protocol for site visits that will eventually expand to other sites across the Tropics.</p>]]></content><author><name>ian-mcgregor</name></author><category term="updates" /><category term="field" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Field update from Panama featuring lightning, drones, and Gigantes.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://deadlabcary.github.io/lab-website/images/field/PXL_20231005_184049637.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://deadlabcary.github.io/lab-website/images/field/PXL_20231005_184049637.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Welcome to new lab members!</title><link href="https://deadlabcary.github.io/lab-website/2023/10/02/new-members.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Welcome to new lab members!" /><published>2023-10-02T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-10-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://deadlabcary.github.io/lab-website/2023/10/02/new-members</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://deadlabcary.github.io/lab-website/2023/10/02/new-members.html"><![CDATA[<!-- excerpt start -->
<p>Welcome to new postdocs (Vanessa and Ian) and field technicians (César and Fernando). 
<!-- excerpt end --></p>

<p>Over the past couple months, the DEAD lab membership has increased in size! Below we welcome two new postdocs and two field technicians.</p>

<p>We first welcome Dr. Ian McGregor coming to us from a recently completed PhD at North Carolina State University. There Ian focused on near real-time deforestation monitoring and built an algorithm to combine optical and synthetic aperture radar data to see how quickly deforestation could be detected. Since August, he has been using his expertise with remote sensing to assist with the lightning project and some of the drone processing.</p>

<p>We next welcome Dr. Vanessa Rubio arriving from University of Notre Dame, where her dissertation revolved around plant community assembly. Vanessa will be spending most of her time on the Gigante project and helping to develop a protocol that eventually will be used at several other sites across the Tropics. Although she started at Barro Colorado Island in October, we are excited to have her in person at the Cary Institute later this fall!</p>

<p>Finally, we have two new field technicians who are joining us to lend their skills in tropical forest fieldwork - César Gutierrez and Fernando Araúz.</p>]]></content><author><name>ian-mcgregor</name></author><category term="updates" /><category term="additions" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome to new postdocs (Vanessa and Ian) and field technicians (César and Fernando).]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://deadlabcary.github.io/lab-website/images/field/groupPhoto_2023.JPG" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://deadlabcary.github.io/lab-website/images/field/groupPhoto_2023.JPG" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Grants and upcoming research</title><link href="https://deadlabcary.github.io/lab-website/2023/08/16/upcoming-research.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Grants and upcoming research" /><published>2023-08-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-08-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://deadlabcary.github.io/lab-website/2023/08/16/upcoming-research</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://deadlabcary.github.io/lab-website/2023/08/16/upcoming-research.html"><![CDATA[<!-- excerpt start -->
<p>Exciting and upcoming lab projects!
<!-- excerpt end --></p>

<p>There are a lot of exciting, upcoming things in the lab! In the last couple months, Evan has had a few proposals funded, including</p>
<ul>
  <li>a NASA project looking at using AI to detect tree flowering phenology</li>
  <li>a major project from NSF that will investigate mortality of large tropical trees. See an overview of the project in a recent <a href="https://www.caryinstitute.org/news-insights/feature/whats-killing-giant-tropical-trees-17m-awards-cary-led-team-aims-find-out">Cary news brief</a>.</li>
