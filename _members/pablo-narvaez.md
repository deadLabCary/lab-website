Research intern from 2021-2022.

I am from Colombia. I studied at Universidad Nacional de Colombia in Medellín and graduated in 2020 as a forestry engineer. Tropical forests always intrigued me, so during my last year of undergrad, I worked in the Amazon surveying mortality drivers in trees. After the pandemic in 2021, I started my internship in the DEAD lab at STRI in Panama, collecting electrical properties of trees to understand the role of lightning events in tree mortality. After my internship in 2022, I started my PhD at Marquette University, evaluating the effects of lianas (or woody vines) on tropical tree demography in Panama.
