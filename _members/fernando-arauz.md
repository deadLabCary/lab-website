I was born in Panama, and I've lived in Panama my whole life. I went to the Technological University of Panama (TUP) and I'm currently working on my thesis to obtain a forestry engineering degree (BSc), for which I'm using remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) to assess the conservation status of a Dry Tropical Forest in the Darién province. My role in the DEAD (Disturbance Ecology And Decomposition) laboratory is to help with data collection on Barro Colorado Island (BCI) as a research technician for the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute.
