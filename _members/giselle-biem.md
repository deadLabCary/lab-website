Iâ€™m a biologist from Brazil. I investigate the ecological mechanisms shaping community structure and dynamics, and the consequences for ecosystem processes, in particular in tropical forests and wetlands. My research combines aspects of community ecology and functional ecology to understand the response of plant communities to natural and altered environments. I graduated and did my Master in UNESP Rio Claro, and I have a PhD in Ecology from INPA, with an internship at the Wageningen University (The Netherlands).

In the DEAD lab, I am working on the Gigante project as a postdoc researcher on UNEMAT. We are investigating the causes and consequences of the mortality of large-sized trees (giant trees) in Tropical forests.
