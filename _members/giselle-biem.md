I’m a biologist from Brazil. I graduated from the São Paulo State University (UNESP Rio Claro, 2010) where I also did my Master’s degree in Botany (2014), and I have a PhD in Ecology from the National Institute for Amazon Research (INPA Manaus, 2019) with an internship at the Wageningen University (WUR, The Netherlands).

I investigate the ecological mechanisms shaping community structure and dynamics, and the consequences for ecosystem processes, in particular in tropical forests and wetlands. My research combines aspects of community ecology and functional ecology to understand the response of plant communities to natural and altered environments.

I worked at INPA as a postdoc researcher investigating floodplain forest trees’ response to fire disturbances (2019-2020), and at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT, Germany), investigating the vulnerability of trees to drought conditions and to extreme hydrological events across Amazonian habitats (2021-2023). At the same time, I collaborated on other projects developed in the Amazon, related to functional traits of plants along natural environmental gradients, and the response of floodplain forests to fire and hydrological changes caused by climate change.

In the DEAD lab, I am working on the Gigante project team as a postdoc researcher on the Brazilian team. We are investigating the causes and consequences of the mortality of large-sized trees (giant trees) in Tropical forests.
