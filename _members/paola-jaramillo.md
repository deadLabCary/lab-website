Paola Jaramillo joined the lab as an intern in 2021-2022 with the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute while completing her Masters at Universidad Nacional de Colombia de Medellin. Paola’s internship focused on the decomposition of trees in the Amacayacu Forest Dynamics plot. For her independent project, Paola explored the role of seasonal inundation in controlling rates of wood decomposition and decomposer colonization. Paola is now completing her PhD at Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazônia (INPA) in Brazil where she is studying the susceptibility of giant tropical trees to water stress under the mentorship of Dr. Flavia Costa. Similar to the Gigante project, her work takes place in the Adolpho Ducke Forest Reserve in Manaus.
