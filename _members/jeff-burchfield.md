Jeff is a research associate in the Earth System Science Center at The University of Alabama in Huntsville where he is a member of the lightning research group. His primary work is with sensors that detect lightning-caused changes in the atmospheric electric field; it is this work that led to Jeff’s affiliation with the DEAD lab. As part of the DEAD lab’s effort to study the effects of lightning on tropical forests, he is a member of the team that operates a network of these lightning sensors in central Panamá. And from data collected by this network, the locations and strengths of lightning strikes to the forest are calculated.
