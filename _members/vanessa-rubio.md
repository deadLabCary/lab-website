I grew up in Colombia. I went to the Universidad de los Andes where I earned Bachelor's degrees in Environmental Engineering as well as Biology. As an undergraduate, I was part of an REU program, did an internship, and was a research assistant at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panam√° where I did research on seedling dynamics, soil respiration, and functional traits. I received my Doctorate degree in 2023 from the University of Notre Dame working with Dr. Nathan Swenson. My doctorate studies centered around understanding the role of stochastic and deterministic processes in the assembly of tropical forests. In particular, I studied how these processes could shape observed dynamics when they occur at different organization levels (e.g., functional groups and species). I recently started a
postdoctoral position with Dr. Evan Gora at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies and [Dr. Adriane Esquivel-Muelbert](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/gees/muelbert-adriane-esquivel) at the University of Birmingham.

As a Postdoctoral Associate, I am involved in the [Gigante project](https://www.caryinstitute.org/science/research-projects/gigante-revealing-what-kills-worlds-largest-trees) to study when, where and why giant trees die, and the role of the abiotic and biotic environment in driving giant tree dynamics. I am currently analyzing how mortality and life-history strategies of giant trees fit into our current understanding of tropical forest dynamics and the role of giant trees in carbon storage.
