I am a Panamanian Biologist, born in Chiriquí and graduated from the Autonomous University of Chiriquí. I have worked on many projects within the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute over the past five years. During the last few years, I collected data to understand how lightning affects tropical forests and helped manage research at the Bocas del Toro station. I am currently the lead research technician and drone pilot in the Dead Lab, where we use drones to monitor the mortality of large trees in the Barro Colorado Island forest in Panama. I help manage various other projects within the lab, including the maintenance and operation of sensors that detect voltage differences to obtain lightning data along the Panamá Canal.
