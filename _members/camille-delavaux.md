Affiliate researcher 2021 - present

I am French and American. Born in PA, grew up in NJ. I went to school at Lehigh University, Yale University, and the University of Kansas. In the lab we worked on understanding what reduces the latitudinal diversity gradient on oceanic islands. The answer includes not only the typical island abiotic island biogeographic variables (island area and distance), but also biotic mutualisms that limit plant establishment at low latitude islands. Currently, I work at ETH Zurich (Switzerland) as a lead scientist.
